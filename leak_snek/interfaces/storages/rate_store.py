    """Protocol defining storage operations for access rate information.

    This protocol outlines the contract for storage systems that aim to store
    and manage access rate information. It defines two primary methods: `read`
    to fetch the rate for a given key, and `write` to store or update the rate
    for a given key.

    Implementers of this protocol can work with different types of keys based
    on the contravariant type variable, `T_contra`.

    Methods
    -------
    - read: Fetch the rate for a given key.
    - write: Store or update the rate for a given key.
